# elitroofingsystems-website

By creating this website, I learned the basic properties of css, the sass preprocessor, the bem methodology, 
I learned how to work with Gulp, I made a slider that is in the home section, 
and a 3d business card that rotates 180 degrees when the user hovers over it with the mouse.
